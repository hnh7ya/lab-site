<p> The overall goals of our research are to provide the Dept. of Defense 
and Armed Forces with proven approaches to detect hidden explosives through the use of 
bio-detecting rodents; to use our behavioral learning strategies in conjunction with the ADROIT 
system to prepare African rats to successfully pass Odor Recognition Tests (ORT) in the same 
manner as explosive trained canines; and to develop rodents to a level of proficiency necessary 
to be deployed in the field by the Dept. of Defense to detect hidden land mines. </p>
