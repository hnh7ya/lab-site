			Dr. Cedric L. Williams is a Professor in the Neuroscience and Behavior Division of the department of Psychology at the 
			University of Virginia. The research interests of the lab involve understanding how physiological changes induced by 
			emotionally arousing events, influences neural circuits in the brain to encode these experiences into memory more 
			effectively. This question is approached with a battery of behavioral learning tasks, immunocytochemistry and neurochemistry 
			to identify chemical transmitters that are released in the brain during learning to affect memory storage. The combined 
			approaches are expected to reveal how meaningful or arousing events influence neural activity within the Amygdala, 
			Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus to transform representations of everyday experiences into permanent memories.  
			<br><br>
			A separate focus of the lab involves the development of novel behavioral and cognitive protocols for olfactory 
			discrimination learning. We design computer-automated instrumental learning techniques in training rodent species to 
			become efficient bio-detectors of explosives odorants or a wide range of hazardous chemical agents. The objective of 
			this work is to create proven behavioral strategies that reduce the time frame for training rodents to reliably search 
			for, identify and distinguish explosive and other harmful odorants from a number of distractor odors.
			<br><br>
			Dr. Williams received a B.A. degree in Psychology from the HBCU, N.C. A & T Univ., a Ph.D. in Physiological Psychology
			from Southern Illinois Univ. and served as a post doctoral researcher at the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and
			Memory at the Univ. of California-Irvine. He joined the faculty at the Univ. of Virginia in 1995 and has served as the 
			Director of the Graduate Program in Psychology (2002-2008), chairman of the Committee for Faculty Rules, representative 
			for the Faculty Senate, member of the Postdoctoral Advisory Council and served on the Professional Development Committee 
			for the Society for Neuroscience.
			<br><br>
			Dr. Williams has served as a grant review panel member for NIH, NSF, Dept. of Defense and Veterans Administration for 
			over 15 years in addition to holding the position of Program Director at NSF’s Neural Systems cluster in the Directorate
			of Biological Sciences (2009-2011). He has received the Alumni Achievement Award from APA’s Diversity in Neuroscience 
			Program, the Director’s Achievement Award for Broadening Participation in the sciences from NSF and funded his research 
			by awards from NIH, NSF, DARPA, ARO and the Dept. of Defense. To view Professor Williams' CV in full, click
