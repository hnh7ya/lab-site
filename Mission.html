<h1>THE WILLIAMS BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE LABORATORY</h1>

<p> <a name="Mission"> <h2> Lab Mission </h2> </a></p>

<p>Explosive landmines left during or remaining after war pose severe risk, 
psychological distress and even death to inhabitants of war-torn regions and those serving in a 
volunteer or security capacity. Over 15,000 people, many of whom are children, are killed or 
maimed by landmines annually. The U.S. Army is engaged in extensive humanitarian demining efforts
to remove hidden explosives left during war and restore these areas to stable societies. <br> <br>

To meet the objectives of the U. S. Army, the Williams’ Lab is involved in a collaborative 
effort with Barron and Assoc. LLC, to train African Giant Pouched Rats and standard laboratory 
rodents to detect target scents associated with explosive odorants using automated methods. 
Our lab coordinates all activities related to designing, updating, providing quantitative 
analysis and implementing the behavioral components of olfactory discrimination learning in the
 detection of hidden explosives. The objective of this work is to discover novel behavioral 
strategies that reduce the time frame for training African Gambian and laboratory rats to 
reliably search for, identify and distinguish TNT explosive residues from a number of distractor 
odors. The research team is also involved in developing an Automated Deployable Robust Training 
(ADROIT) system that can be deployed in the field to reduce the human labor and time associated 
with producing explosive detecting rodents. This computer driven apparatus is used to 
automatically administer a series of operant and instrumental learning techniques to shape 
unique forms of olfactory discrimination learning necessary to detect harmful odorants. </p>
