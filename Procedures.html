<h1>THE WILLIAMS BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE LABORATORY</h1>

<p> <a name="Procedures"> <h2> Lab Procedures </h2> </a> </p>

<p> The lab is currently conducting daily training and data collection 
with African Gambian rats and the standard Sprague Dawley laboratory rat. 
The Gambian rats are a special species that have not been investigated in the laboratory. 
Our lab has taken a leading role in assessing many of the social, behavioral and cognitive 
functions that enable this species to be developed into efficient bio-detectors of explosives 
or hazardous chemical agents. Current research assistants are involved in running behavioral 
experiments with the ADROIT system, collecting training data, entering information into the 
computer, data analysis and the auxiliary tasks of daily laboratory 
and equipment upkeep. </p>
