		<h2> Our Mission </h2>
		<p>Explosive landmines left during or remaining after war pose severe risk, psychological distress and even death to inhabitants of war-torn regions and those serving 
		in a volunteer or security capacity. Over 15,000 people, many of whom are children, are killed or maimed by landmines annually. The U.S. Army is engaged in extensive 
		humanitarian demining efforts to remove hidden explosives left during war and restore these areas to stable societies. </p>
		<p>To meet the objectives of the U. S. Army, the Williamsâ€™ Lab is involved in a collaborative effort with Barron and Assoc. LLC, to train African Giant Pouched Rats and 
		standard laboratory rodents to detect target scents associated with explosive odorants using automated methods. Our lab coordinates all activities related to designing, 
		updating, providing quantitative analysis and implementing the behavioral components of olfactory discrimination learning in the detection of hidden explosives. 
		The objective of this work is to discover novel behavioral strategies that reduce the time frame for training African Gambian and laboratory rats to reliably search for, 
		identify and distinguish TNT explosive residues from a number of distractor odors. The research team is also involved in developing an Automated Deployable Robust Training 
		(ADROIT) system that can be deployed in the field to reduce the human labor and time associated with producing explosive detecting rodents. This computer driven apparatus 
		is used to automatically administer a series of operant and instrumental learning techniques to shape unique forms of olfactory discrimination learning necessary to detect 
		harmful odorants.</p>
		<p>The lab is currently conducting daily training and data collection with African Gambian rats and the standard Sprague Dawley laboratory rat. The Gambian rats are a 
		special species that have not been investigated in the laboratory. Our lab has taken a leading role in assessing many of the social, behavioral and cognitive functions 
		that enable this species to be developed into efficient bio-detectors of explosives or hazardous chemical agents. Current research assistants are involved in running 
		behavioral experiments with the ADROIT system, collecting training data, entering information into the computer, data analysis and the auxiliary tasks of daily laboratory 
		and equipment upkeep.</p>
		<p> The overall goals of our research are to provide the Dept. of Defense and Armed Forces with 
		proven approaches to detect hidden explosives through the use of bio-detecting rodents; to use our behavioral learning strategies in conjunction with the ADROIT 
		system to prepare African rats to successfully pass Odor Recognition Tests (ORT) in the same manner as explosive trained canines; and to develop rodents to a level 
		of proficiency necessary to be deployed in the field by the Dept. of Defense to detect hidden land mines.</p>
